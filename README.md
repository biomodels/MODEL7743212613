# MODEL7743212613: Radulescu2008_NFkB_hierarchy_M_5_8_12

## Installation

Download this repository, and install with distutils

`python setup.py install`

Or, install using pip

`pip install git+https://github.com/biomodels/MODEL7743212613.git`

To install a specific version (in this example, from the 2014-09-16 BioModels release)

`pip install git+https://github.com/biomodels/MODEL7743212613.git@20140916`

## Usage

Importing the model package.

`import MODEL7743212613 as model`

Get the SBML string from the model

`print model.sbmlString`

If [python-libsbml](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-libsbml) bindings are
installed, the libsbml.SBMLDocument object is also accessible

`model.sbml`


# Model Notes


# NFkB model M(5,8,12) - minimal model

This is a model of NFkB pathway functioning from hierarchy of models of
decreasing complexity, created to demonstrate application of model reduction
methods

Radulescu O, Gorban A., Zinovyev A., Lilienbaum. A. Robust simplifications of
multiscale models in

The models are provided in CellDesigner v3.5 format. The name of the model
M(x,y,z) should be deciphered as following

x - number of species y - number of reactions

Simulation protocol: The model can be simulated in CellDesigner directly, or
in any simulator supporting events. The simulation period should be set up in
40 hours (t=144000 sec). The 'signal' event applies signal to the
